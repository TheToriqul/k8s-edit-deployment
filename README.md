## 📋 Project Overview

This project demonstrates advanced Kubernetes deployment management capabilities, focusing on real-world scenarios of deployment inspection, troubleshooting, and modification. Through this implementation, I've developed expertise in handling Kubernetes deployments, managing container images, and implementing robust debugging practices.

## 🎯 Key Objectives

- Master Kubernetes deployment management using both imperative and declarative approaches
- Implement professional-grade deployment inspection and troubleshooting workflows
- Develop expertise in managing container image configurations
- Establish best practices for Kubernetes resource management
- Create reproducible deployment modification procedures

## 🏗️ Project Architecture
When a deployment is edited via kubectl, the Kubernetes Deployment Controller orchestrates the update process by creating a new ReplicaSet for the updated configuration while gradually scaling down the old ReplicaSet. This controlled transition ensures zero-downtime updates as new pods with the updated specifications are created and old pods are systematically terminated, maintaining the desired application state throughout the process.
